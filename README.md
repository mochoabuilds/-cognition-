Learn the basics of computer vision using the best of the best at the right price.

By Michael V. Ochoa 

# MAJOR RESEARCH CHALLENGES

Human pose estimation (Who is here?)
Blurring face for privacy
Action recognition (Whatcha up to?)
Temporal association (Who has what?)
Object classficiation (What is it?)
Action analysis

Branching computer object peristance models across two cameras
Handing constant partial and full occulsions 
Restrucuting the code to Rustic
Navigating open source software support
Determining the metrics that improve downstream performance
