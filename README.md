# "YOLO 23:  A Model for Real Time Object and Action Recognition On Cost Friendly Hardware"

By Michael V. Ochoa 

Learn the basics of embedded computer vision using the best of the best at the right price.  Build and train a computer vision system to understand "whose hands are doing what, with what object?" (i.e. scene recognition).
 
# ABSTRACT

On this page, we explore three methods for scene recognition.  In Part I, we present an ethnographic study showing the natural scene categorization of a neighborhood market.  In Part II, we study what human subjects perceive when they glance at images of a neighborhood market.  In Part III, a computer vision model is developed for natural scene recognition with very few training examples.  We do this by designing a Bayesian learning technique that incorporates past information to achieve its goal.  Finally in Part IV, we show how natural scene categorization could be implemented without much human supervision in a hierarchical Bayesian model.
