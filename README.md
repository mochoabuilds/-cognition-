Computer Vision for Non-STEM Majors:  A Mixed Methods Approach (2020)
By Michael Valentino Ochoa et la.

INTRODUCTION

- In this paper, we explore methods for scene recognition (i.e. Whose hands are doing what with what object?) in computer vision systems. 
- In Part I, we present an ethnographic study showing our natural scene categorization of a neighborhood market. 
- In Part II, we study what human subjects perceive when they quickly glance at a photograph of a neighborhood market. 
- In Part III, a computer vision model categorizes the natural scene properties of a neighborhood market. 
- Finally in Part IV, we show how ethnographic data from part I, quick glance perceptions in part II and computer vision categorization from part III are expressions of 'gut feelings' about neighborhood markets.  We channel those feelings into a machine language that helps our computer vision/AI system better understanding these dynamic third places.


RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION

- Use clever tricks to coax enormous functionality out of edge computing devices. 


PART I  ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH

- Ethnographic research is driven by firsthand participation in unfamiliar social circles to pull a sense of what’s relevant in that world.  For the purpose of this research we frequent our own neighborhood markets on the Chicago Northside.   

PART II  QUICK-LOOK GLANCES

PART III  COMPUTER VISION MODEL

- Our computer vision model uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for object detection and action recognition.  Algorithms divide images into regions, bounding boxes and probabilities to understand “whose hand are doing what, with what object?”.

- Who is here? // Human pose estimation	
- Whatcha up to? // Action recognition
- Who has what? // Temporal association 
- What is it? // Object classification

 
OK! LET'S GET STARTED!  

01 Installing Required Packages and Libraries for Computer Vision Model

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

CURRENT CHALLENGES

- Determining the metrics that improve downstream performance
- Navigating open source software 
- Handling constant partial and full occlusions
- Branching object persistence models across multiple cameras
- Restructuring the code to Rustic
- Handling changing databases schema, data types and complex objects
- Handling the velocity of vision data across different frequencies

DISCUSSION

SOCIETAL APPLICATIONS

- We want to rework the pipes channeling money at neighborhood markets.  The mass adoption of smartphones means many midwesterners are now in arms reach of a mini terminal.  Our product enables neighborhood markets across the midwest to perform autonomous checkout using smartphones, our sofware and the best hardware at the best price.

- Pilot program under development.
