“YOLO 23:  A Model for Real Time Action Recognition and Item Classification On Cost Friendly Hardware”  

MAJOR RESEARCH CHALLENGES

— Dense multi-object tracking in the wild
— Multi-view consensus
— Handling constant partial and full occlusions 
— Has to run in real-time
— Has to be 100% accurate
— Restructuring code to Rustic
— Navigating OpenCV's support 
— Managing unergonomic multi-dimensional array support
— Finding metrics that continuously improve downstream performance.
